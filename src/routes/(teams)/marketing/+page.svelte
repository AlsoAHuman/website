		Marketing is the backbone of the team; this branch allows the rest of the team to function.
		Marketing members are responsible for raising the thousands of dollars
		needed for travel costs and purchase orders for parts.
		The marketing team is also responsible for creating advertisements that increase engagement with the school population as well as
		filling out the technical documentation, the documentation of everything that the team has done,
		including the design of the robot, the safety precautions taken during the building, and the expenses of things we bought or paid for.
