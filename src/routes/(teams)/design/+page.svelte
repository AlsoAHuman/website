		The design of the robot must first be created for any branch to properly function. From creating prototypes of the ROV to researching materials, the design team helps bring the ROV to life. The design team mainly uses Autodeskâ€™s Fusion 360 app or OnShape as an alternative. The design team works on modeling the robot in Fusion 360 and printing out different objects to support the robot. Once final designs have been submitted, the design team looks over all the designs to offer constructive criticism, and a final vote is made.
