        While the engineering team creates the fundamentals of the robot, our electrical team brings it to life.
        They weave electricity throughout the entire robot, with intense complexity and mastery suited only for our electrical members.
        The electrical team wires and powers the robot, granting it the capability to fulfill the goals set by MATE.
        They set up power supplies, voltage, currents, and more that remain integral to the completion of the robot.
        The electrical team also collaborates with the coding team regularly, working together to suit the coding teamâ€™s needs.
        Electrical engineers are in rapidly growing demand, and their electrical work here at Deep Sea Tactics will be invaluable for our students' future.
