        <p>Deep Sea Tactics is comprised of 5 specialized groups that all contribute to the success of our design. These teams consist of Electrical, Marketing, Modeling, Design, and Coding, all of which having a key role in the ROV. Each team overcomes their own challenges, along with working together to tackle larger ones. Our teams collectively strive to succeed and have put in strong effort throughout the entire school year to the broad aspects of maintaining a company.</p>
        <p>Deep Sea Tactics uses 3D modeling software to visualize the ROV and how different parts fit together. Laser cutting was used to make the main body and larger parts, whilst the rest was 3D printed with PLA. To complete part of the product demonstration, Deep Sea Tactics created an arm to complete tasks such as picking up items and delivering them to the objective. One part of the arm was the claw, being custom designed to fit all our needs, along with being very cost efficient.</p>
        <p>The tasks this year are designed to highlight the United Nations Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development and inspire the global community to embrace environmental, social, and governance (ESG) efforts to create a sustainable future on our ocean planet.</p>
