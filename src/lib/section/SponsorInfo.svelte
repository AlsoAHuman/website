		Despite our ability to make it to nationals, we operate on a tight budget that operates
		year-by-year. This restricts our ability to purchase new equipment, travel to competitions, and
		have room to innovate, crippling our ability to compete with other teams. We need your help to
		continue our mission of inspiring the next generation of engineers and scientists in our
		community.
